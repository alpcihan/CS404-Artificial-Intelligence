## Projects
See the related project folders for more detailed description.
### Project 1: Solving Bloxorz Using A* and UCS
Implemented [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) and [UCS](https://www.educba.com/uniform-cost-search/) algorithms to solve the early stages of the Bloxorz Puzzle and make a performance comparison.
### Project 2: Solving Aquarium Puzzle Using CSP
Represented the Aquarium Puzzle as a [Constraint Satisfaction Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction) and solved it using the [constraint](https://pypi.org/project/python-constraint/) library.
### Project 3: Solving Fox, Goose, and Bag of Beans Puzzle Using Planning
Represented the [Fox, Goose, and Bag of Beans Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem) in [ADL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_description_language) format and solved it using the [Fast Downward](http://www.fast-downward.org/HomePage).
### Project 4 (Bonus): Alpha–Beta Pruning
Implementation of the [Alpha–beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning#:~:text=Alpha%E2%80%93beta%20pruning%20is%20a,%2C%20Go%2C%20etc.) algorithm to create a two-player zero-sum game that the player play against the AI.

### Project 5: Bayesian Network
A [Bayesian Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network) example in [Samiam](http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/samiam/).
